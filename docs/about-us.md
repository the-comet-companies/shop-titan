## Necessity is the mother of invention

This solution came about because there was no solution I liked. So I built my own, over 15 years.
And now I am offering it to the rest of the world.

I did not want to move, and I did not like feeling stressed.
I realized stress came from not having optics on where anything is, having to stay on top of the team.
So I built a solution, where I could be anywhere in the world, and still run a large scale print shop.

Of course its to the help of the team. But I had to do a lot to get it there.

**Every click has a follow action.**

We built this as automated as possible, as delegatable as possible, and for the least amount of issues or mistakes to go wrong.
