# PainPoint Framework

1. **Commas are not good**
   - They dilute. Start w/ the problem, just 1 until someone says YES THATS ME!

2. **Pain Point**
   - Start with a problem they relate to, and you have them hooked.

3. **Solution**
   - Position your product as solution.
   - How we help the positive result (ie: allow them to focus on what they do best).

4. **Dream Outcome**
   - THIS will happen if you work with us.

5. **Negative Stakes**
   - Paint the stakes if they don't work with us.

6. **CALL TO ACTION**
   - They need to be told what action to take.
   - Need to specifically tell people what to do and what action to take (People will go where we tell them to go…).
   - They are wondering at the last second is this the right decision.
   - Reassure them this is the right decision for them.
   - Have to give someone a win or lose scenario if they buy the product or not.
